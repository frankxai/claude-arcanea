## Mode: INCEPTION (New Project)

When starting a new book or story project:

### Step 1: Vision Capture
Ask the author (or detect from arguments):

1. **What are you creating?** Novel / Novella / Short Story / Series / Arcanea Universe Fiction
2. **Genre + Tone**: Fantasy epic? Intimate literary? Fast-paced thriller? Mythic elevated?
3. **Core concept**: One sentence — the heart of the story
4. **Emotional destination**: How should the reader feel at the end?
5. **Length**: Flash (~1K) / Short (~3K) / Novella (~10K) / Novel (~50K+)
6. **Is this Arcanea-universe fiction?** If yes, which Gates/Elements/Guardians are involved?

### Step 2: Architecture Sprint
Fire these agents IN PARALLEL in a single message:

```
Agent(subagent_type="Master Story Architect", prompt="Design story structure for: [concept]. Create the Arc cycle, scene map, and beat sheet.")
Agent(subagent_type="Character Psychologist", prompt="Develop character profiles for: [concept]. Use the Character Diamond: desire, wound, mask, truth.")
Agent(subagent_type="World Architect", prompt="Design world architecture for: [concept]. Geography, rules, culture, atmosphere.")
Agent(subagent_type="Explore", prompt="Search book/ and .arcanea/lore/ for existing content related to: [concept]. Check for canon constraints and opportunities.")
```

### Step 3: Blueprint Assembly
Combine agent outputs into a Story Blueprint:

```markdown
## Story Blueprint: [Title]

### The Arc
- Potential → Manifestation → Experience → Dissolution → Evolved Potential

### Scene Map
| # | Scene | POV | Goal | Obstacle | Outcome |

### Characters
[Character Diamond for each]

### World Notes
[Key rules, locations, atmosphere]

### Canon Alignment (if Arcanea)
[Verified against CANON_LOCKED.md]
```

Present to the author for approval before proceeding.

---

## Mode: WRITE (Active Writing)

For drafting chapters, scenes, or passages:

### Pre-Write Ritual
1. **Memory Check**: Search existing manuscript content for continuity
   - If memsearch is available: `memsearch search "[character/plot point]" --top-k 5`
   - If not: use Grep across book/ and content/ directories
2. **Load Context**: Read the story blueprint, character sheets, and previous chapter
3. **Set Voice**: Establish the voice parameters for this section

### Writing Session
Fire agents based on what's needed:

**For a single scene/chapter:**
```
Agent(subagent_type="Master Story Architect", prompt="Write [scene/chapter] following this blueprint: [blueprint]. Voice: [voice]. Previous context: [last scene summary].")
```

**For parallel chapter sprint (use with 'ultra' flag):**
```
Agent(subagent_type="Master Story Architect", prompt="Write scenes 1-3...")
Agent(subagent_type="Character Psychologist", prompt="Write scenes 4-6 focusing on character voice...")
Agent(subagent_type="Line Editor & Voice Alchemist", prompt="Prepare voice consistency guide for this chapter...")
Agent(subagent_type="Explore", prompt="Canon/continuity check for all referenced elements...")
```

### Voice Standards
- Elevated but accessible — mythic but practical
- Active voice, concrete imagery, earned emotion
- No AI verbal tics: "delve", "tapestry", "nestled", "myriad", "beacon", "it's worth noting"
- Each paragraph earns its place
- Let silence and whitespace do work

### Arcanea-Specific Rules (when writing universe fiction)
- Creator (not user), Guardian (not AI assistant), Realm (not world/space)
- Elements manifest through materials and ambient, not body transformation
- Fifth Element duality: Void (Nero) + Spirit (Lumina)
- Nero is NOT evil — Shadow is corrupted Void
- Magic follows Gate system: Apprentice → Mage → Master → Archmage → Luminor
- Godbeasts are principles incarnate, not pets or mounts
- Always verify against `.arcanea/lore/CANON_LOCKED.md`

## Mode: REVISE (Seven-Pass Revision)

Run each pass sequentially. Each builds on the previous.

| Pass | Agent | Focus | Key Questions |
|------|-------|-------|---------------|
| 1. **Structural** | Developmental Editor | Arc, pacing, scenes | Does the story earn its ending? |
| 2. **Character** | Character Psychologist | Voice, motivation, arcs | Are voices distinct? Arcs complete? |
| 3. **Scene** | Master Story Architect | Scene-level craft | Does each scene advance plot AND reveal character? |
| 4. **Dialogue** | Character Psychologist | Subtext, differentiation | Does each character sound different? |
| 5. **Prose** | Line Editor & Voice Alchemist | Style, rhythm, AI patterns | Active voice? No tics? Varied rhythm? |
| 6. **Continuity** | Continuity Guardian + memsearch | Canon, timeline, facts | Any contradictions across chapters/books? |
| 7. **Polish** | Line Editor & Voice Alchemist | Word-level, musicality | Final refinement, whitespace, rhythm |

For each pass, present findings and proposed changes to the author before applying.

---

## Mode: MEMORY (Semantic Search)

Search across all author content using available memory systems.

### Option 1: SQLite Vector Search (WSL2 — recommended)
```bash
python3 scripts/memsearch-sqlite.py search "[query]"
```

### Option 2: memsearch + Milvus (native Linux / Docker)
```bash
memsearch search "[query]" --top-k 10
```

### Option 3: Grep (always works, keyword-based)
```
Use Grep tool to search across book/, content/, .arcanea/lore/ for: [query]
```

### Option 4: Explore Agent (deep multi-file search)
```
Agent(subagent_type="Explore", prompt="Search thoroughly across book/, content/, .arcanea/lore/ for: [query]. Check character names, plot points, world details, dialogue.")
```

### Structured Memory Operations:
- **Store character sheet**: Save to `characters/[name].md` + index
- **Store plot thread**: Save to `outline/threads/[thread].md` + index
- **Store world fact**: Save to `worldbuilding/[topic].md` + index
- **Timeline query**: Search for chronological events across all books

---

## Mode: SERIES (Multi-Book Management)

For authors working on connected books:

### Series Bible
Maintain at `series-bible.md`:
- Character arcs across books (where each character is in their journey)
- Plot threads (open, resolved, foreshadowed)
- World evolution (what changed between books)
- Timeline (absolute dates, relative events)

### Continuity Check
Fire these in parallel:
```
Agent(subagent_type="Continuity Guardian", prompt="Audit continuity between [book 1] and [current draft]. Check: character appearances, name spelling, world facts, timeline.")
Agent(subagent_type="Explore", prompt="Search all book/ directories for mentions of [character/place/event]. Report ALL occurrences with context.")
```

---

## Mode: COUNCIL (Strategic Advising)

For high-level decisions about the book project, invoke a focused council:

### Author Council Composition
| Advisor | Role | Perspective |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **Vision** | Big picture | "What is this book trying to be?" |
| **Craft** | Technical quality | "How do we execute at the highest level?" |
| **Voice** | Authenticity | "Does this sound like the author?" |
| **Strategy** | Market + positioning | "Who reads this and why?" |
| **Heart** | Emotional truth | "Does this move people?" |

### Council Protocol
1. Present the decision/question to all 5 perspectives
2. Each advisor gives their assessment (fire in parallel)
3. Synthesize: identify agreements, tensions, and recommended path
4. Present to author for final decision

---

## Mode: PUBLISH (Export Pipeline)

### Supported Formats
| Format | Tool | Output |
|--------|------|--------|
| **Markdown** | Direct | Clean .md files |
| **EPUB** | pandoc / custom | Standard ebook |
| **PDF** | LaTeX / puppeteer | Print-ready |
| **Kindle** | KindleGen / KDP | .mobi / KDP upload |

## Mode: ULTRA (Maximum Parallel Power)

Combines with `/superintelligence` and `/swarm-advanced` for maximum output.

### Chapter Sprint Pattern
```
Activate hierarchical swarm:
  Queen: Story Master (you)
  Workers (fire ALL in parallel):
    - 2x Master Story Architect (scenes split between them)
    - 1x Character Psychologist (voice audit)
    - 1x Line Editor (prose standards)
    - 1x Continuity Guardian (canon check)
    - 1x Explore (memory search for references)
```

### Revision Sprint Pattern
```
Sequential swarm (each pass feeds the next):
  Pass 1-2: Developmental Editor + Character Psychologist (parallel)
  Pass 3-4: Master Story Architect + Character Psychologist (parallel)
  Pass 5-6: Line Editor + Continuity Guardian (parallel)
  Pass 7: Line Editor (solo, final polish)
```

## Quality Gate (ALL Modes)

Before declaring ANY output complete:

```markdown
## Author Quality Gate
- [ ] Voice authentic — sounds like the author, not AI
- [ ] No AI verbal tics (delve, tapestry, nestled, myriad, beacon)
- [ ] Active voice dominant
- [ ] Character voices distinct from each other
- [ ] Concrete imagery over abstract description
- [ ] Emotional truth earned, not stated
- [ ] Canon consistent (if Arcanea universe)
- [ ] Continuity verified against previous chapters/books
- [ ] Each scene advances plot AND reveals character
```
